# Fit-In (Version 1)
<ul>
  <li>Ruby on Rails (version 6) with PostgreSQL, HTML, and SCSS</li>
  <li>RESTful | CRUD | Validations | Authorization | Authentication</li>
 </ul>
<p>Fit-In was my final project for the Full-stack Web Developer Bootcamp that I completed on March 5, 2020.  It’s designed to be used as an in-house system at a Fitness Retreat in Thailand, where guests are given access to the App upon check-in.  Its purpose is to streamline the boring admin processes and make it easy for guests to book workout sessions, order food, and more.  The mission is to “Book. Order. Go! Fit-In more time for fun!”.  I decided to challenge myself to use pure SCSS, as I mostly used Bootstrap for previous projects due to time constraints.  This project is still ongoing, as I want to add more features and also incorporate React in another version of the project.  The company I based this project on already has an updated website for their other business purposes, but if this application were to be used by them, I would probably have to integrate the application with some of their existing systems, like their POS system used to order food.</p>
